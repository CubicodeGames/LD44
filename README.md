## The Game

In this game you control two characters â€“ a Heart and a Coin.

Your goal is to reach the red platform with both characters.

The Heart character loses hearts over time and can only collect coins.
The Coin character loses coins over time and can only collect hearts.
To fill up the energy, you have to collect one key with each character and move with both to a green platform. There you can exchange the collected items.

The red platform is only visible, when both characters have collected a key.

The level is completed as soon as both characters reached the red platform.

The game is over, when one character falls down, runs out of energy or collects both keys.
